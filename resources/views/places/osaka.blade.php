                Osaka is a large port city and commercial center on the Japanese island of Honshu. 
                It's known for its modern architecture, nightlife and hearty street food. 
                The 16th-century shogunate Osaka Castle, which has undergone several restorations, is its main historical landmark. 
                It's surrounded by a moat and park with plum, peach and cherry-blossom trees. Sumiyoshi-taisha is among Japanâ€™s oldest Shinto shrines.
